<b><i>
The trump administratin said on Wednesday thta it would ban the sale of most
flavorede e-cigarettes, at a time when hundreds of people have been sickened by
mysterious lung illnesses and teenage vaping continues to rise.</i></b>
</hr>
</p>

<h2><b>Reasons</b></h2>
<p>
This summer's startling reports of vaping-related respiratory illnesses, which
now near 500 cases in nearly three dozen states and have possible links to 6
deaths, have only amplifies concerns and renewed calls for a total ban
on largely unregulated pipeline of e-cigarette and cannabis vaping
products.
</p>

<h2><b>Young Victims</b></h2>
<p>
Five million minors, mostly in their high school years, reported that they had
uswed e-cigarettes recently, he said. about one-quarter of the nation's high
school students re[ported vaping within the last 30 days in their
year's annual survey, up from 20 percent last year.
</p>

<h2><b>Announcement</b></h2>
<p>
Matthew L. Myers, president of the campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the
admiistration's decision historic. President Trump's announcement that tej
government will remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market is an
extraordinary and necessary step, he said. This is a public health crisis and
we cannot afford more delays in confronting it.
